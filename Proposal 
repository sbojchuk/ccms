Hello sbojchuk!

I don't know much Spring and don't know why do you preffer it to EJB. I am learning EJB.
I think it is needed to add to Readme.txt lines to create new user in mysql and grant him access because you use user
'root' with password 'sbojchuk' in your app. This needs the following in mysql:
1. open command line ;
2. using option cd navigate to bin folder where you have mysql shell, e.g.:
> cd /d d:\mysql-5.5.27-win32\bin
This moves you to location d:\mysql-5.5.27-win32\bin

Next type :
mysql -u root -p
Enter password: (click Enter in case of no password)
mysql> CREATE DATABASE ccms CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 DEFAULT COLLATE utf8_general_ci;
Query OK, 1 rows affected
mysql> create user 'root'@'localhost' identified by 'sbojchuk';
Query OK, 0 rows affected
mysql> grant all privileges on *.* to 'root'@'localhost';
Query OK, 0 rows affected

Next using maven build and deploy project on tomcat
mvn eclipse:eclipse //create eclipse project
mvn tomcat:run //start tomcat

I think it will reconcile many beginners.

Don't you have some sql file to fill the database with sample data so that I don't have to advise a lot before trying it out!

Thank you very much!
